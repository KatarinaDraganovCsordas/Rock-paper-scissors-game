# Rock-paper-scissors-game
Hey there! This is my first project, a humble Rock-Paper-Scissors game that I built from scratch. I'm excited to share it with you!

About the Project
This project is a result of my journey into coding, fueled by YouTube tutorials and a ton of self-learning. As a beginner, I wanted to start with something fun and straightforward, and what better way than a classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors?
