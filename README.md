# Rock-paper-scissors-game
Hey there! This is my first project, a humble Rock-Paper-Scissors game that I built from scratch. I'm excited to share it with you!

About the Project
This project is a result of my journey into coding, fueled by YouTube tutorials and a ton of self-learning. As a beginner, I wanted to start with something fun and straightforward, and what better way than a classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors?

How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the game in your preferred code editor.
3. Run the program and get ready to challenge the computer to a duel of Rock, Paper, Scissors!

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or just enjoy a quick game to pass the time.
